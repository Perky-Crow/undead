<h2>What is this book about?</h2>

<p>The goal of this book is to show how to make a game without using any extra libraries or tools. Even though these tools are out there, doing it without them helps us understand what's happening under the hood.</p>

<p>It's not a requirement for becoming a game developer, but it's fun and encourages to think creatively about how to make the most of what we have.</p>

<p>So, we put all the extra tools in a box and get started.</p>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>We still need a few basic tools to make a game in JavaScript. We need a code editor, a web browser, and a web server.</p>

<p>We will use Google Chrome as our web browser and VSCode as our code editor. For the web server, I usually use npm's http-server.</p>
